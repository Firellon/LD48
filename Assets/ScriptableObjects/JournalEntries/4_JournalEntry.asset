  entryTitle: Whispers in the Wind
  entryDescription: "08-10-2009, 20:04\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to think straight
    out here. I keep hearing whispers, soft and almost inaudible, but persistent.
    They\u2019re like the wind, except there\u2019s no breeze\u2014nothing to carry
    a sound. I\u2019ve tried to follow them, to pinpoint where they\u2019re coming
    from, but they seem to be everywhere and nowhere at once. It\u2019s like the
    forest is speaking to me, but I can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s saying.
    Every time I stop to listen, I get this creeping sensation at the back of my
    neck, like something\u2019s standing right behind me. I\u2019ve started moving
    faster, trying to outrun the feeling, but it\u2019s always there, just at the
    edge of my awareness."
