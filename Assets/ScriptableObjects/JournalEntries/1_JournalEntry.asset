  entryDescription: "Found the first ingredient near the creek, just as the book
    said. The plant was exactly where it was supposed to be, nestled between two
    moss-covered rocks. But as soon as I plucked it, everything around me fell silent.
    The birds stopped singing, and even the insects seemed to vanish. I could feel
    the weight of the silence pressing down on me, like the forest itself was holding
    its breath. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just a coincidence,
    but the feeling lingers. Maybe it's just nerves\u2014after all, I\u2019ve never
    done anything like this before. I need to keep moving, the clearing can\u2019t
    be too far now. I can\u2019t afford to let my imagination get the best of me."
