  entryTitle: The Marked Tree
  entryDescription: "08-10-2009, 17:22\n\nI came across something strange today\u2014a
    tree marked with ancient symbols. They\u2019re carved deep into the bark, worn
    by time but still visible. They\u2019re not in the book, and I\u2019ve never
    seen anything like them before. The symbols almost seem to hum with energy, like
    they\u2019re alive somehow. I reached out to touch one, and for a moment, it
    felt like the ground shifted beneath me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s connected
    to the altar or the ritual, but something about it feels important. I\u2019ve
    marked the tree\u2019s location on my map, just in case. Maybe I\u2019ll come
    back to it later, after the ritual is done."
