  entryDescription: "I had to leave some of my gear behind. The weight was slowing
    me down, and I can\u2019t afford to be anything less than fast. The shadows are
    growing longer, even though the sun hasn\u2019t set yet. It\u2019s like time
    itself is warping around me. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the forest is
    closing in, that whatever I summoned is shaping the world around me. The fear
    is starting to eat away at my sanity, and I\u2019m not sure how much longer I
    can keep moving. I think I\u2019m being hunted, and every instinct is telling
    me to run, but there\u2019s nowhere left to go."
