  entryDescription: "09-10-2009, 12:37\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to make my way back,
    but nothing looks familiar anymore. The forest is different\u2014darker, more
    twisted. The paths I took earlier are gone, replaced by dense underbrush and
    trees that seem to loom closer with every step. The light is fading fast, and
    the darkness feels like it\u2019s alive, pressing in from all sides. And that
    presence\u2014it\u2019s still with me. I can feel it, just out of sight, watching,
    waiting. Every time I stop, I hear footsteps that aren\u2019t mine, growing closer,
    then stopping when I move again. I\u2019m trapped out here, with no way to know
    which direction leads to safety."
