  entryDescription: "09-10-2009, 09:00\n\nThe ritual didn\u2019t go as planned. I
    did everything by the book, but instead of summoning Grandma, I felt something
    else\u2014something ancient and filled with rage. The air around me grew colder,
    and the light from the candles flickered and nearly went out. I felt a pressure
    in my chest, like something was trying to push me out of the clearing. I called
    out to Grandma, but there was no answer\u2014only a deep, resonating silence
    that felt more like a presence than an absence. I\u2019m packing up to leave,
    but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve disturbed something that was
    meant to stay buried. I need to get out of here before it\u2019s too late."
