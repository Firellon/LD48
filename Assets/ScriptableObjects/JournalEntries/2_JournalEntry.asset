  entryName: Eyes in the Trees
  entryDescription: "The deeper I go, the more the forest seems to close in around
    me. The trees are so dense now, their branches interlocking overhead, blocking
    out most of the light. It\u2019s like the forest is trying to swallow me whole.
    I keep feeling like there are eyes on me, watching my every move. Every rustle
    in the underbrush, every crack of a twig, makes my heart skip a beat. I can\u2019t
    help but glance over my shoulder every few steps, but there\u2019s never anything
    there. It\u2019s just the trees, the shadows... or at least that\u2019s what
    I keep telling myself. The path is getting harder to follow, but I know I\u2019m
    close to the clearing. I have to be."
