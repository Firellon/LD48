  entryDescription: "09-10-2009, 03:12\n\nThe moment I began setting up for the ritual,
    the forest seemed to react. The ingredients started to sizzle and hiss before
    I even lit the candles, like they were charged with some kind of energy. Then,
    out of nowhere, a cold wind swept through the clearing, carrying with it a deep,
    hollow sound, like a distant moan. I glanced around, trying to find the source,
    but all I could see were shadows\u2014shadows that seemed to move on their own,
    just out of the corner of my eye. My heart\u2019s pounding in my chest, and I
    can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m being watched, not by something in
    the trees, but by the forest itself. Whatever I\u2019ve started, I can\u2019t
    stop now."
