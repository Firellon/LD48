    reading this, please, don\u2019t follow the path I took. I didn\u2019t mean for
    any of this to happen. I just wanted to speak to her one last time, but instead,
    I\u2019ve brought something terrible into the world. I can hear it now, getting
    closer with every breath I take. The darkness is so thick, it\u2019s like a living
    thing, wrapping around me, pulling me down. I\u2019m so cold, so tired. I don\u2019t
    think I can keep running. It\u2019s almost here, and I don\u2019t want to know
    what happens when it catches me. Please, forgive me for what I\u2019ve done."
