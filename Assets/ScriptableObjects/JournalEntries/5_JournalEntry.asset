  entryName: The Unsettling Clearing
  entryDescription: "I finally found the clearing, but it\u2019s nothing like I expected.
    The air here is thick, almost suffocating, and there\u2019s this strange smell\u2014like
    damp earth and something else I can\u2019t quite place. The stone altar stands
    in the center, ancient and weathered, but the carvings on it are still sharp,
    almost as if they\u2019ve been recently made. I thought I would feel relieved
    finding the place, but instead, I\u2019m filled with this deep sense of unease.
    The silence is even more oppressive here, like the forest itself is holding its
    breath. I\u2019ve set up the ingredients, but my hands are shaking. I\u2019ve
    come too far to turn back now, but something about this place feels... wrong."
